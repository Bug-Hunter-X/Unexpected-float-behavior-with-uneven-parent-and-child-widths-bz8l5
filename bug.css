The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to create two divs that each take up 50% of their parent container's width and float side-by-side. However, if the parent container's width is not an even multiple of the div's width (50%), some browsers may render the divs incorrectly, causing them to overflow their parent or overlap.
